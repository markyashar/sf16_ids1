    "* transforming the values at our disposal into a representation that a given machine learning algorithm can use and understand\n",
    "* creating new, derived features from the available features (using domain expertise) and use them when training a model\n",
    "* dealing with missing values, as most ML algorithms can't handle unknown values. They must be filled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with the first case, transformation, and talk about the three most common transformations necessary to get data into a state where it can be used to train most ML models:\n",
    "* **feature scaling**: making it so that all columns (features) range over the same values is very helpful for many (but not all) machine learning models. In some cases, scaling along samples is useful, as well.\n",
    "* **turning categorical values into numerical values**: machine learning algorithms only understand numbers, not categories.\n",
    "* **handling missing values**: Models break when you give them `NaN`s, what are some strategies to replace `NaN`s with \"good\" (i.e. useful) numbers?"

    "Standardization of datasets is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators implemented in scikit-learn; they might behave badly if the individual features do not more or less look like standard normally distributed data: Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.\n",

    "For instance, many elements used in the objective function of a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector Machines or the l1 and l2 regularizers of linear models) assume that all features are centered around zero and have variance in the same order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger than others, it might dominate the objective function and make the estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.\n",
