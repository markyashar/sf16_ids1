## Peer Review Guidelines

You will be assigned to review the project drafts of two of your peers. You will have one week to provide them with feedback.

Expectations:
* Read everything they wrote!
* If they provided their data, review it and try to understand it.
* Read their code and try to understand their thought process.
* If their code can be run, try running it.
* Spend at least one hour reviewing their project (including the time it takes to write the feedback).

Your feedback would ideally consist of:
* Strengths of their project (things you particularly like about it)
* Comments about things you think could be improved
* Questions about things you don't understand
* Comments about their code
* Links to resources or code snippets that might be useful to them
* Suggestions for next steps
* Guiding principle: Give feedback that would be helpful to you if it was your project!

You should take a quick glance through their project as soon as possible, to make sure you understand what they have given you and what files you should be reviewing. If you're unclear, ask them about it!
