## Overview
The final project should represent original work applying data science techniques to an interesting problem. You own your final projects, but you should be talking frequently with your instructor and classmates about them.

Address a data-related problem in any field you're passionate about. If you care about the subject matter, you'll create a better project and it will be a lot more fun for you!

You can either use [publicly available data](public_data.md) or your own data that you can legally share with the rest of the class. Competing in a data science/stats competition (INCLUDING ANY PAST COMPETITIONS) is also a project option.

## Milestones

### TBD Date: Decide on your project

You will be expected to:
    
 * have talked with me about your project idea(s) and made a decision about what you're going to do. I can help you to choose between different ideas, advise you on the appropriate scope for your project, and ensure that your project question might reasonably be answerable using the data science tools and techniques taught in the course.
    
 * have created a GitHub repository for your project (even if it is a Kaggle competition). It should include a **write-up** that answers the following questions:

    1. What is the question you hope to answer?
    2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
    3. What do you know about the data you're using so far?
    4. Why did you choose this topic?

    #### Note on including your data in your GitHub repo:

    If it's not practical to include your entire dataset in your GitHub repository, you should link to your data source and provide a sample of the data. (GitHub has a [size limit](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/) of 100 MB per file and 1 GB per repository.)

### TBD Date: Project check-in #1

You will be expected to:

 * check in with me about what you've done so far on your project. You need to be able to show me the work you have done so far, as well as your plans for the project going forward. Everything you've done so far on the project should be included and fully updated in your public GitHub repository.

 * include a **brief write-up** (1/2 page) in your GitHub repo that answers the following questions:

    1. What data have you gathered, and how did you gather it?
    2. How have you explored the data and what insights have you gained as a result?
    3. Will you be able to answer your question with this data, or do you need to gather more data (or adjust your question)?
    4. What modeling approach are you using to answer your question?

### TBD Date: Project check-in #2

You will be well into working on your project. Please don't procrastinate

### October 20: Final project presentation

Your project repository on GitHub should contain the following:

 * **Code:** commented Python notebooks, and any other code you used in the project
 * **Data:** data files in "raw" or "processed" format

##### Logistics and tips for success

 * Please submit a link to your repository by 6pm on October 20.
 * You do not have to present, but it would be awesome if you did. Depending on interest, you will have ~10 minutes to talk about your project, what you learned, and what you would have liked to have done if you had extra time (and what you will do in the future).
 * If your presentation is too long, focus it around the most interesting aspects of your project, rather than trying to include every last detail.
 * Tell your story in an engaging fashion. No one wants to sit through YABP (Yet Another Boring Presentation).
